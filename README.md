# Private Events

## About

Private Events is an application similar to Eventbrite and focusses on many-to-many relationships. Users can sign up, create and attend events and send and accept invitations.

It is part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com).

Most features have been implemented. However, users cannot yet send out or accept invitations to events.
